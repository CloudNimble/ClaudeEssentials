The `Inputs` namespace contains classes for deserializing JSON data that Claude Code sends to hooks via stdin. Each hook event type has a corresponding input class.

## Input Classes

| Class | Hook Event | Description |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| `PreToolUseHookInput<T>` | PreToolUse | Received before a tool executes |
| `PostToolUseHookInput<T,R>` | PostToolUse | Received after a tool completes |
| `PermissionRequestHookInput<T>` | PermissionRequest | Received when permission is requested |
| `UserPromptSubmitHookInput` | UserPromptSubmit | Received when user submits a prompt |
| `StopHookInput` | Stop | Received when Claude finishes responding |
| `SubagentStopHookInput` | SubagentStop | Received when a subagent completes |
| `NotificationHookInput` | Notification | Received for notifications |
| `SessionStartHookInput` | SessionStart | Received when a session starts |
| `SessionEndHookInput` | SessionEnd | Received when a session ends |
| `PreCompactHookInput` | PreCompact | Received before context compaction |

All input classes inherit from `HookInputBase` which provides common properties like `SessionId`, `TranscriptPath`, and `CurrentWorkingDirectory`.
